# rocket Engine
its another engine. It's a project for me to jump back into Direct X and potentially Vulkan as well.

Goals here are to setup a pretty end-to-end framework, i'd like to reproduce some of the really cool features with unreal (without going like full tools and everything) just some really basic versions of features like:

- Garbage Collection & Virtual Memory Management Fun
- Render Graph complete with a DX12 PBR renderer
- Scene Graph system
- and a super simple custom physics engine.

Yes i made a logo - I like making logos.
